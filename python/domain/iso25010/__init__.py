    ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines:
    
    1. A quality in use model composed of five characteristics (some of which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics)
       that relate to the outcome of interaction when a product is used in a particular context of use. This system model is
       applicable to the complete human-computer system, including both computer systems in use and software products in use.
    2. A product quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics) that
       relate to static properties of software and dynamic properties of the computer system. The model is applicable to both
       computer systems and software products.

    The characteristics defined by both models are relevant to all software products and computer systems. The characteristics
    and subcharacteristics provide consistent terminology for specifying, measuring and evaluating system and software product
    quality. They also provide a set of quality characteristics against which stated quality requirements can be compared for
    completeness.
    
    Although the scope of the product quality model is intended to be software and computer systems, many of the characteristics
    are also relevant to wider systems and services.
